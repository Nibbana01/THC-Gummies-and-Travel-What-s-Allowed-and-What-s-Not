# THC-Gummies-and-Travel-What-s-Allowed-and-What-s-Not
From my experience, traveling with THC gummies can be tricky. Laws change by state and country, and what’s fine in one place could get you in trouble in another. I always check local rules before packing them. My Nibbana gummies are my go-to, but I keep them at home unless I’m sure it’s legal.
